<h2>7.1 Outputs of the forward simulations<a class="headerlink" href="#outputs-of-the-forward-simulations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once your job has run, you will be able to access the output of the
simulation in three ways:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Clicking on the ‘<em>Control’</em> tab in the ‘<em>Simulation’</em> section of
the ‘<em>Forward</em> <em>Modelling’</em> panel (see section 5.7):</p>
<p>It shows a list of the simulation jobs that have been launched with,
among others, the corresponding ‘<em>Name</em>’, ‘<em>Description’</em>,
‘<em>Status’</em> and ‘<em>Date’</em> of the run; if you do not see the event you
have just run then click ‘<em>Refresh list</em>’ to load this in. By
clicking on the blue-eye icon next to each run you will be redirected to
the ‘<em>Results’</em> section showing the selected run and all its outputs
(in the far left of the opened panel) as described in the next point.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Directly checking under the ‘<em>Results’</em> section:</p>
<p>The simulation results can be searched using the ‘<em>Open Run’</em> button
which is on the top left. This enables you to search for runs that for
instance involve earthquakes in a range of magnitudes (as shown in
Figure 7.1), or a range of depths, latitudes, longitudes, etc. For a
full list of the parameters for which it is possible to search for,
please see the ‘<em>Terms’</em> drop down menu. You can then select the
simulation of interest from the list of previous runs satisfying the
searching criteria that appears on the screen after clicking the
‘<em>Search’</em> button. As in case 1), the far left of the panel will then
show the outputs of this simulation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Using the ‘<em>iRODS</em>’ panel: see section 7.4.</p>
<p><img alt="image0" src="_images/image17.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 7.1:</strong> Example of searching simulations involving events in a
selected magnitude range.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Focusing now on points 1) and 2), selecting an output from the left hand
part of the ‘<em>Results</em>’ panel will bring up a provenance diagram in
the top right window of the ‘<em>Results’</em> section marked as ‘<em>Data
Dependency Graph’</em>. If this is done for instance for the .kml file that
is output, all of the constituent inputs needed for this result are
shown by a dark blue circle bounded in yellow, and the outputs are shown
by a simple dark blue circle.</p>
<p>The bottom right window, marked as <em>‘Data products’</em>, gives further
details of the output file that is selected and lists possible errors
occurred during the production of this output. To open the file
concerned, click the blue link marked ‘<em>Open’</em> or the one marked
‘<em>Download’</em> appearing in the dialog window. Moreover, with the button
<em>‘Produce Download Script’</em> you can get a piece of code to download the
selected output via gsissh terminal.</p>
<p>Using the ‘<em>Search’</em> button in the ‘<em>Data</em> <em>products’</em> section of
the ‘<em>Results’</em> panel it is also possible to search for all the output
files of a specific mime-type (e.g., png, kmz, etc.) for a specific
simulation.</p>
<p>Finally, you can also visualise the input files for the selected
simulation, such as the quakeML file, which contains information about
the source or sources that are input into the model. This is done using
the ‘<em>View Inputs’</em> button on the top left of the ‘<em>Results’</em> panel.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="waveform-outputs">
<h2>7.1.1 Waveform outputs<a class="headerlink" href="#waveform-outputs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The primary outputs of any seismic simulation are the recorded
waveforms. These can be viewed most simply as a .png file as shown in
figure 7.2. To access these figures, after selecting a given simulation
(as explained above), use the ‘<em>Search’</em> button in the ‘<em>Data</em>
<em>products’</em> window (of the ‘<em>Results’</em> panel) to search for
‘image/png’ type of files. Otherwise, waveforms can be downloaded as
seed files searching and downloading ‘application/octet-stream’
mime-type files.</p>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>Figure 7.2:</strong> Example of waveform output.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The simulation code produces one file for each of the three components
of a seismic station and, depending on the Par_file set up (see
Appendix 1), the seismograms can be in displacement, velocity or
acceleration, or all of them.</p>
<p>The three components of different seismometers that are output can also
be viewed in a more interactive form, by downloading the *.kmz file
that is automatically output from the simulation run and viewing it in
Google Earth as shown in Figure 7.3. This kmz file can be downloaded by
searching for a mime-type ‘<em>application/vnd.google-earth.kmz’</em> in the
‘<em>Search’</em> section of ‘<em>Data</em> <em>products’</em>.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="animation-outputs">
<h2>7.1.2 Animation outputs<a class="headerlink" href="#animation-outputs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The VERCE platform can also be used to produce animations or movies of
the waveforms propagating out from the simulated earthquake event. These
animations can be projected onto the Earth’s surface as in the snapshot
example of Figure 7.4, or can show the propagation over all the external
faces of the mesh (i.e., topography+vertical edges+bottom) depending on
the Par_file set up as described in Appendix 1.</p>
<p>The movie file *.mp4 is automatically output from the portal and can be
downloaded by searching for a mime-type
‘<em>application/vnd.google-earth.kmz</em>’ in the ‘<em>Search’</em> section of
‘<em>Data</em> <em>products’</em> (in the ‘<em>Results’</em> panel). The animations shown
at the top of the movie file and the one on the bottom left (Figure 7.4)
represent the three components of the waveform velocity propagation,
while the animation at the bottom right is the instantaneous peak ground
velocity, i.e. a map of the maximum ground velocity for each time step
of the simulation.</p>

<div class="section" id="other-outputs">
<h2>7.1.3 Other outputs<a class="headerlink" href="#other-outputs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The portal outputs can also be processed externally with your own
routines to produce, for example, ground motion maps as shown for an
event in Northern Italy in Figure 7.5. In particular, this kind of maps
can be obtained by processing a binary file called <em>shakingdata</em>
produced in output by SPECFEM3D_Cartesian if in the Par_file the user
sets the flag</p>
<p>CREATE_SHAKEMAP = .true.</p>

<p>One of the main changes that will be introduced in the next release of
the portal (autumn/winter 2017) is the automatic production, through a
dedicated workflow in the portal, of such ground motion maps, i.e. PGD,
PGV and PGA maps. A single *.png picture containing the three maps will
be generated from the automatic processing of the <em>shakingdata</em> file.</p>

<div class="section" id="downloading-observed-data">
<h2>7.2 Downloading observed data<a class="headerlink" href="#downloading-observed-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the main goals of a seismological analysis is the comparison of
simulated results with observed data. Thus, after running a waveform
simulation, the portal allows users to download from European data
archives the recorded seismograms corresponding to the simulated
earthquake.</p>
<p>The section marked as ‘<em>Download’</em> under the ‘<em>Forward Modelling’</em>
panel is dedicated to this task and it is composed by the following
sub-sections that guide the users to launch a data -download job.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><em>’Setup’</em> tab:</p>
<p>A list of all the simulations that have been run is shown in this
window. By selecting one of them, the information on the corresponding
earthquake (source location, origin time) and run (NSTEP, DT) are
automatically passed to the portal thanks to the metadata stored along
with each simulation job.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>‘Submit’</em> tab:</p>
<p>In the upper window you see the input parameters for the download job
based on the selection in the previous tab; in the lower window you can
setup the submission parameters, in particular the specific workflow and
the number of cores of the HPC resource to run the data-download job
(see the example in Figure 7.6). Click on ‘<em>Submit’</em> on the lower
right to launch the job.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>‘Control’</em> tab:</p>
<p>As for the case of simulation jobs in section 7.1, this window shows a
list of the download jobs that have been launched and their
corresponding status, among other information. The <em>‘blue-eye’</em> icon
next to each run links you again to the main ‘<em>Results’</em> page where
this time you visualize the outputs of the selected data-download job
and the provenance graphs.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the outputs can be accessed by searching for the specific
download job directly from the ‘<em>Results’</em> panel (see section 7.1) or
from the ‘<em>iRODS</em>’ panel (see section 7.4).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The output files of a data-download job are both seed and png files of
the recorded traces downloaded from European archives. Use the
‘<em>Search’</em> button in the <em>‘Data products’</em> window of the ‘<em>Results’</em>
tab to search for mime-type ‘<em>application/octet-stream’</em> or
‘<em>image/png’</em>, respectively.</p>

<div class="section" id="waveform-processing">
<h2>7.3 Waveform processing<a class="headerlink" href="#waveform-processing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once both a simulation job and a download job have been run, users can
exploit another feature of the portal to pre-process observed and
synthetic waveforms in order to prepare them for comparison analyses.</p>
<p>In the ‘<em>Forward Modelling’</em> panel, by clicking on the
‘<em>Processing’</em> tab you should go through the following sub-sections to
set up and launch a processing job.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><em>‘Data Setup’</em> tab:</p>
<p>The window on the top left shows a list of the waveform simulations that
have been run, while the window on the top right shows a list of the
data-download jobs that have been run. By selecting a simulation and a
download run, a list of the seismic stations involved in the two jobs
appears in the window below and the portal automatically highlights the
common stations, i.e. those for which both data and synthetics are
stored in its database. Use the checkbox on the left of each station to
select those for which you are interested in processing both simulated
and recorded seismograms in order to then compare them.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">‘<em>Processing Setup’</em> tab:</p>
<p>Here you can built-up a customized pipeline of processing analyses to be
applied to the recorded and simulated waveforms selected in the previous
panel. A list of the most common seismological processing functions
(here called <em>Processing Elements</em>, and abbreviated to <em>PEs</em>) is
reported in the far left window. Drag the selected PEs into the top
right window following the order of the operations you want to apply on
the seismograms.</p>
<p>For each PE of the pipeline you can choose to apply the operation on
both data and synthetics or on just one of them using the checkboxes
‘<em>raw’</em> and ‘<em>synt’</em>. As an example, usually the operation of
removing the instrument response (represented by the PE
<em>remove_response</em>) is applied only on the raw data, while on the
synthetics one applies a pre-filtering function (<em>pre_filter</em> PE) to
replicate the bandpass filter done by <em>remove_response</em> function on the
data but without any deconvolution (see Figure 7.7). Moreover, the
checkbox ‘<em>visu’</em> allows you to produce a png file showing the result
of the specific analysis, while the checkbox ‘<em>store’</em> allows to also
store the processed seismogram as a seed file.</p>
<p>For each PE you can also modify the corresponding parameters. Clicking
on the row of a given PE in the ‘<em>PE Workflow’</em> window, the
corresponding parameters appear in the window below and you can set up,
for example, the type of de-trend, the type of taper and its percentage,
the limit frequencies for the selected filter.</p>
<p>Finally, on the top of the ‘<em>PE Workflow’</em> window a drop down menu
allows to select if the output of the processing will be in
displacement, velocity or acceleration, and with a checkbox you can
decide to rotate the seismic traces from NS and EW to radial and
vertical components.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>‘Submit’</em> tab:</p>
<p>As in the case of section 7.2, this tab shows a summary of the set up
for the processing job, in particular the list of stations to which the
processing will be applied and a list of the processing operations that
compose the custom pipeline. Then, you can setup the submission
parameters in the lower window and launch the processing job by clicking
on ‘Submit’ on the lower right.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><em>‘Control’</em> tab:</p>
<p>As previously, the window shows a list of the processing jobs that have
been launched and the blue-eye icon links to the main ‘<em>Results</em>’
page where the outputs of the selected job can be explored together with
the provenance graphs. The outputs can be also accessed by searching for
the specific processing job directly from the ‘<em>Results</em>’ panel (see
section 7.1) or from the ‘<em>iRODS</em>’ panel (see section 7.4).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The output products of a processing job can be png files of the
processed traces, if the option ‘<em>visu’</em> is checked, or/and seed files
containing the processed seismograms, if the option ‘<em>store</em>’ is on
(see above). Use the <em>‘Search’</em> button in the ‘<em>Data products’</em> window
of the <em>‘Results’</em> tab to search for mime-type ‘<em>image/png’</em> or
‘<em>application/octet-stream’</em>, respectively.</p>

<div class="section" id="misfit-calculation">
<h2>7.4 Misfit calculation<a class="headerlink" href="#misfit-calculation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After simulating the seismic wave field, downloading the raw seismic
data and pre-processing both, the VERCE portal allows users to compare
synthetic and recorded seismograms and to quantitatively assess the
goodness of fit. Evaluating this fit is essential to approach the
inverse problem in seismology and there are numerous algorithms and
procedures to accomplish this task. In the portal we have so far
implemented two different established techniques for misfit calculation
and a third option that combines the two:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>PYFLEX</strong></p>
<p>This is a python port (L. Krisher; <a class="reference external" href="http://krischer.github.io/pyflex">http://krischer.github.io/pyflex</a>) of
the fortran code FLEXWIN (Maggi et al., 2009;
<a class="reference external" href="http://geodynamics.org/cig/software/flexwin">http://geodynamics.org/cig/software/flexwin</a>). Considering full observed
and synthetic traces, the code selects a set of time-windows suitable
for waveform comparison based on given input parameters and estimates
cross-correlation, time-shift and amplitude ratio within each window.
The code allows for an automated selection of the windows handling large
data volumes and also complex 3D simulated waveforms, hence it is
particularly useful for iterative tomographic inversions (Maggi et al.,
2009). For a complete description of the method and the parameters see
the manual of PYFLEX (or FLEXWIN).</p>
<p>In the portal this option corresponds to ‘<em>misfit_type = pyflex’</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Kristeková’s misfit method</strong></p>
<p>This is a python code based on the method developed by Kristeková et al.
(2006) and Kristeková et al. (2009). The method compares observed and
synthetic full-waveforms and allows the following time-frequency (TF)
misfit criteria to be estimated:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>time-frequency envelope misfit (TFEM)</li>
<li>time-frequency phase misfit (TFPM)</li>
<li>time envelope misfit (TEM)</li>
<li>time phase misfit (TPM)</li>
<li>frequency envelope misfit (FEM)</li>
<li>frequency phase misfit (FPM)</li>
<li>envelope misfit (EM)</li>
<li>phase misfit (PM)</li>
</ul>
<p>This method allows for comparing arbitrary time signals in their entire
TF complexity, thus providing a detailed TF anatomy of the disagreement
between two full signals from the point of view of both envelope and
phase (Kristeková et al., 2009). For a complete description of the
method see Kristeková et al. (2006) and Kristeková et al. (2009).</p>
<p>In the portal this option corresponds to ‘<em>misfit_type =
time_frequency’</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>PYFLEX + Kristeková’s misfit method</strong></p>
<p>In this case the time windows are selected using the code PYFLEX and
then the time-frequency misfit criteria are estimated on this windows
using Kristekova’s method.</p>
<p>In the portal this corresponds to ‘<em>misfit_type =
pyflex_and_time_frequency’</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The section of the VERCE portal for misfit calculation is accessible
through the ‘<em>Misfit</em>’ tab in the ‘<em>Forward Modelling</em>’ panel
and it consists of the following sub-sections that allows for the set-up
of a misfit job.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>‘Setup’</em> tab:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div>Select one of the processing job that have been run and that are listed
in the upper window of this panel. Then select the ‘<em>Misfit type</em>’
from the drop-down menu considering that</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>‘<em>pyflex’</em> corresponds to option 1 above</li>
<li>‘<em>time</em>_<em>frequency’</em> corresponds to option 2 above</li>
<li>‘<em>pyflex_and_time_frequency’</em> corresponds to option 3 above</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div>For each misfit procedure the lower window of the panel shows the
corresponding parameters that should be set up by the user. In
particular, for option 1 – ‘PYFLEX’ the tuning parameters control
the window selection and are fully described in the manual of the
code; for option 2 – ‘Kristeková’s misfit method’ the main
parameters are the minimum and maximum period at which the waveforms
have been filtered; option 3 – ‘PYFLEX + Kristeková’s misfit method‘
contains all the parameters of the two previous options. (See Figure 7.8).</div></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">‘<em>Submit’</em> tab:</p>
<p>A summary of the chosen misfit method and set up parameters is shown in the upper window of this section. Then, you can setup the submission
parameters in the lower window and launch the misfit job by clicking on ‘<em>Submit</em>’ on the lower right.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">‘<em>Control</em>’ tab:</p>
<p>As always, the window shows a list of the misfit jobs that have been
launched and the blue-eye icon links to the main ‘<em>Results</em>’ page
where the outputs of the selected job can be explored together with the
provenance graphs. The outputs can be also accessed by searching for the
specific misfit job directly from the ‘<em>Results</em>’ panel (see section
7.1) or from the ‘<em>iRODS</em>’ panel (see section 7.4).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The output products of a misfit job are png files showing the waveform
comparison for each component of each selected seismic station. The
figures are different depending on the misfit option chosen in the
‘<em>Setup</em>’ tab (see examples in Figures 7.9 and 7.10). To access
these output files use the ‘<em>Search</em>’ button in the ‘<em>Data
products</em>’ window of the ‘<em>Results</em>’ tab searching for mime-type
‘<em>image/png</em>’.</p>

<h2>7.4 Accessing the results through iRODS<a class="headerlink" href="#accessing-the-results-through-irods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After any of the jobs described above (simulation, download, processing
and misfit) is finished, the output products are shipped from the HPC
resource, that performed the calculation, to the store repository of the
VERCE portal. This storage is managed through iRODS that provides a
repository shared among the federated nodes of the VERCE organisation.
How to create an account in iRODS is described in section 3 of this
manual, and after that you can log in selecting the ‘<em>IRODS</em>’ panel
in the portal main menu (see Figure 7.11).</p>
<p><img alt="image10" src="_images/image113.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 7.11:</strong> Screenshot of the ‘IRODS’ panel in the VERCE portal</p>
<p>Entering iRODS gives you access to your personal folder where you can
navigate the results of all your completed jobs (of any type) as
anticipated above. The run results are organised in trees of subfolders
with the main directory called using the ‘<em>Name</em>’ you have chosen
for your job (see section 5.6), as shown for example in Figure 7.12.</p>
<p><img alt="image11" src="_images/image122.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 7.12:</strong> Example of the iRODS subfolder structure containing
the results of the jobs.</p>
<p>A given job can be selected by double-clicking on the relative folder
and, navigating the subdirectories, you can access all the same input
and output files of each job that have been described in the above
sections.</p>
<p>It is very important that in order to visualise or download any output
or input data from the portal, both via the ‘<em>Results</em>’ tab or the
‘<em>iRODS</em>’ tab, you always need to firstly log in into the
‘<em>iRODS</em>’ panel (Figure 7.11) because the storage database is
accessible only to authenticated users.</p>
