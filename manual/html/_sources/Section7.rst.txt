7. Processing and Accessing the Results
=======================================

7.1 Outputs of the forward simulations
--------------------------------------

Once your job has run, you will be able to access the output of the
simulation in three ways:

1) Clicking on the ‘\ *Control’* tab in the ‘\ *Simulation’* section of
   the ‘\ *Forward* *Modelling’* panel (see section 5.7):

   It shows a list of the simulation jobs that have been launched with,
   among others, the corresponding ‘\ *Name*\ ’, ‘\ *Description’*,
   ‘\ *Status’* and ‘\ *Date’* of the run; if you do not see the event you
   have just run then click ‘\ *Refresh list*\ ’ to load this in. By
   clicking on the blue-eye icon next to each run you will be redirected to
   the ‘\ *Results’* section showing the selected run and all its outputs
   (in the far left of the opened panel) as described in the next point.

2) Directly checking under the ‘\ *Results’* section:

   The simulation results can be searched using the ‘\ *Open Run’* button
   which is on the top left. This enables you to search for runs that for
   instance involve earthquakes in a range of magnitudes (as shown in
   Figure 7.1), or a range of depths, latitudes, longitudes, etc. For a
   full list of the parameters for which it is possible to search for,
   please see the ‘\ *Terms’* drop down menu. You can then select the
   simulation of interest from the list of previous runs satisfying the
   searching criteria that appears on the screen after clicking the
   ‘\ *Search’* button. As in case 1), the far left of the panel will then
   show the outputs of this simulation.

3) Using the ‘\ *iRODS*\ ’ panel: see section 7.4.

   |image0|

   **Figure 7.1:** Example of searching simulations involving events in a
   selected magnitude range.

Focusing now on points 1) and 2), selecting an output from the left hand
part of the ‘\ *Results*\ ’ panel will bring up a provenance diagram in
the top right window of the ‘\ *Results’* section marked as ‘\ *Data
Dependency Graph’*. If this is done for instance for the .kml file that
is output, all of the constituent inputs needed for this result are
shown by a dark blue circle bounded in yellow, and the outputs are shown
by a simple dark blue circle.

The bottom right window, marked as *‘Data products’*, gives further
details of the output file that is selected and lists possible errors
occurred during the production of this output. To open the file
concerned, click the blue link marked ‘\ *Open’* or the one marked
‘\ *Download’* appearing in the dialog window. Moreover, with the button
*‘Produce Download Script’* you can get a piece of code to download the
selected output via gsissh terminal.

Using the ‘\ *Search’* button in the ‘\ *Data* *products’* section of
the ‘\ *Results’* panel it is also possible to search for all the output
files of a specific mime-type (e.g., png, kmz, etc.) for a specific
simulation.

Finally, you can also visualise the input files for the selected
simulation, such as the quakeML file, which contains information about
the source or sources that are input into the model. This is done using
the ‘\ *View Inputs’* button on the top left of the ‘\ *Results’* panel.

7.1.1 Waveform outputs
----------------------

The primary outputs of any seismic simulation are the recorded
waveforms. These can be viewed most simply as a .png file as shown in
figure 7.2. To access these figures, after selecting a given simulation
(as explained above), use the ‘\ *Search’* button in the ‘\ *Data*
*products’* window (of the ‘\ *Results’* panel) to search for
‘image/png’ type of files. Otherwise, waveforms can be downloaded as
seed files searching and downloading ‘application/octet-stream’
mime-type files.

    |image1|

    **Figure 7.2:** Example of waveform output.

The simulation code produces one file for each of the three components
of a seismic station and, depending on the Par\_file set up (see
Appendix 1), the seismograms can be in displacement, velocity or
acceleration, or all of them.

The three components of different seismometers that are output can also
be viewed in a more interactive form, by downloading the \*.kmz file
that is automatically output from the simulation run and viewing it in
Google Earth as shown in Figure 7.3. This kmz file can be downloaded by
searching for a mime-type ‘\ *application/vnd.google-earth.kmz’* in the
‘\ *Search’* section of ‘\ *Data* *products’*.

    |image2|

    **Figure 7.3:** Three components of a synthetic seismogram produced
    for an earthquake in Central Italy, observed on the interactive
    Google Earth tool. The seismograms are shown in displacement,
    velocity and acceleration.

7.1.2 Animation outputs
-----------------------

The VERCE platform can also be used to produce animations or movies of
the waveforms propagating out from the simulated earthquake event. These
animations can be projected onto the Earth’s surface as in the snapshot
example of Figure 7.4, or can show the propagation over all the external
faces of the mesh (i.e., topography+vertical edges+bottom) depending on
the Par\_file set up as described in Appendix 1.

The movie file \*.mp4 is automatically output from the portal and can be
downloaded by searching for a mime-type
‘\ *application/vnd.google-earth.kmz*\ ’ in the ‘\ *Search’* section of
‘\ *Data* *products’* (in the ‘\ *Results’* panel). The animations shown
at the top of the movie file and the one on the bottom left (Figure 7.4)
represent the three components of the waveform velocity propagation,
while the animation at the bottom right is the instantaneous peak ground
velocity, i.e. a map of the maximum ground velocity for each time step
of the simulation.

|image3|

**Figure 7.4:** Snapshot of the movie for an earthquake in Central
Italy produced from the VERCE platform using a regional simulation in
SPECFEM3D\_Globe.

7.1.3 Other outputs
-------------------

The portal outputs can also be processed externally with your own
routines to produce, for example, ground motion maps as shown for an
event in Northern Italy in Figure 7.5. In particular, this kind of maps
can be obtained by processing a binary file called *shakingdata*
produced in output by SPECFEM3D\_Cartesian if in the Par\_file the user
sets the flag

CREATE\_SHAKEMAP = .true.

|image4|

**Figure 7.5:** A ground shaking map produced with SPECFEM3D\_Cartesian
for an event occurring in Northern Italy.

One of the main changes that will be introduced in the next release of
the portal (autumn/winter 2017) is the automatic production, through a
dedicated workflow in the portal, of such ground motion maps, i.e. PGD,
PGV and PGA maps. A single \*.png picture containing the three maps will
be generated from the automatic processing of the *shakingdata* file.

7.2 Downloading observed data
-----------------------------

One of the main goals of a seismological analysis is the comparison of
simulated results with observed data. Thus, after running a waveform
simulation, the portal allows users to download from European data
archives the recorded seismograms corresponding to the simulated
earthquake.

The section marked as ‘\ *Download’* under the ‘\ *Forward Modelling’*
panel is dedicated to this task and it is composed by the following
sub-sections that guide the users to launch a data -download job.

-  *’Setup’* tab:

   A list of all the simulations that have been run is shown in this
   window. By selecting one of them, the information on the corresponding
   earthquake (source location, origin time) and run (NSTEP, DT) are
   automatically passed to the portal thanks to the metadata stored along
   with each simulation job.

-  *‘Submit’* tab:

   In the upper window you see the input parameters for the download job
   based on the selection in the previous tab; in the lower window you can
   setup the submission parameters, in particular the specific workflow and
   the number of cores of the HPC resource to run the data-download job
   (see the example in Figure 7.6). Click on ‘\ *Submit’* on the lower
   right to launch the job.

-  *‘Control’* tab:

   As for the case of simulation jobs in section 7.1, this window shows a
   list of the download jobs that have been launched and their
   corresponding status, among other information. The *‘blue-eye’* icon
   next to each run links you again to the main ‘\ *Results’* page where
   this time you visualize the outputs of the selected data-download job
   and the provenance graphs.

   Otherwise, the outputs can be accessed by searching for the specific
   download job directly from the ‘\ *Results’* panel (see section 7.1) or
   from the ‘\ *iRODS*\ ’ panel (see section 7.4).

The output files of a data-download job are both seed and png files of
the recorded traces downloaded from European archives. Use the
‘\ *Search’* button in the *‘Data products’* window of the ‘\ *Results’*
tab to search for mime-type ‘\ *application/octet-stream’* or
‘\ *image/png’*, respectively.

|image5|

job.

7.3 Waveform processing 
------------------------

Once both a simulation job and a download job have been run, users can
exploit another feature of the portal to pre-process observed and
synthetic waveforms in order to prepare them for comparison analyses.

In the ‘\ *Forward Modelling’* panel, by clicking on the
‘\ *Processing’* tab you should go through the following sub-sections to
set up and launch a processing job.

-  *‘Data Setup’* tab:

   The window on the top left shows a list of the waveform simulations that
   have been run, while the window on the top right shows a list of the
   data-download jobs that have been run. By selecting a simulation and a
   download run, a list of the seismic stations involved in the two jobs
   appears in the window below and the portal automatically highlights the
   common stations, i.e. those for which both data and synthetics are
   stored in its database. Use the checkbox on the left of each station to
   select those for which you are interested in processing both simulated
   and recorded seismograms in order to then compare them.

-  ‘\ *Processing Setup’* tab:

   Here you can built-up a customized pipeline of processing analyses to be
   applied to the recorded and simulated waveforms selected in the previous
   panel. A list of the most common seismological processing functions
   (here called *Processing Elements*, and abbreviated to *PEs*) is
   reported in the far left window. Drag the selected PEs into the top
   right window following the order of the operations you want to apply on
   the seismograms.

   For each PE of the pipeline you can choose to apply the operation on
   both data and synthetics or on just one of them using the checkboxes
   ‘\ *raw’* and ‘\ *synt’*. As an example, usually the operation of
   removing the instrument response (represented by the PE
   *remove\_response*) is applied only on the raw data, while on the
   synthetics one applies a pre-filtering function (*pre\_filter* PE) to
   replicate the bandpass filter done by *remove\_response* function on the
   data but without any deconvolution (see Figure 7.7). Moreover, the
   checkbox ‘\ *visu’* allows you to produce a png file showing the result
   of the specific analysis, while the checkbox ‘\ *store’* allows to also
   store the processed seismogram as a seed file.

   For each PE you can also modify the corresponding parameters. Clicking
   on the row of a given PE in the ‘\ *PE Workflow’* window, the
   corresponding parameters appear in the window below and you can set up,
   for example, the type of de-trend, the type of taper and its percentage,
   the limit frequencies for the selected filter.

   Finally, on the top of the ‘\ *PE Workflow’* window a drop down menu
   allows to select if the output of the processing will be in
   displacement, velocity or acceleration, and with a checkbox you can
   decide to rotate the seismic traces from NS and EW to radial and
   vertical components.

-  *‘Submit’* tab:

   As in the case of section 7.2, this tab shows a summary of the set up
   for the processing job, in particular the list of stations to which the
   processing will be applied and a list of the processing operations that
   compose the custom pipeline. Then, you can setup the submission
   parameters in the lower window and launch the processing job by clicking
   on ‘Submit’ on the lower right.

-  *‘Control’* tab:

   As previously, the window shows a list of the processing jobs that have
   been launched and the blue-eye icon links to the main ‘\ *Results*\ ’
   page where the outputs of the selected job can be explored together with
   the provenance graphs. The outputs can be also accessed by searching for
   the specific processing job directly from the ‘\ *Results*\ ’ panel (see
   section 7.1) or from the ‘\ *iRODS*\ ’ panel (see section 7.4).

The output products of a processing job can be png files of the
processed traces, if the option ‘\ *visu’* is checked, or/and seed files
containing the processed seismograms, if the option ‘\ *store*\ ’ is on
(see above). Use the *‘Search’* button in the ‘\ *Data products’* window
of the *‘Results’* tab to search for mime-type ‘\ *image/png’* or
‘\ *application/octet-stream’*, respectively.

be applied on observed and synthetic seismograms.

7.4 Misfit calculation
----------------------

After simulating the seismic wave field, downloading the raw seismic
data and pre-processing both, the VERCE portal allows users to compare
synthetic and recorded seismograms and to quantitatively assess the
goodness of fit. Evaluating this fit is essential to approach the
inverse problem in seismology and there are numerous algorithms and
procedures to accomplish this task. In the portal we have so far
implemented two different established techniques for misfit calculation
and a third option that combines the two:

1. **PYFLEX**

   This is a python port (L. Krisher; http://krischer.github.io/pyflex) of
   the fortran code FLEXWIN (Maggi et al., 2009;
   http://geodynamics.org/cig/software/flexwin). Considering full observed
   and synthetic traces, the code selects a set of time-windows suitable
   for waveform comparison based on given input parameters and estimates
   cross-correlation, time-shift and amplitude ratio within each window.
   The code allows for an automated selection of the windows handling large
   data volumes and also complex 3D simulated waveforms, hence it is
   particularly useful for iterative tomographic inversions (Maggi et al.,
   2009). For a complete description of the method and the parameters see
   the manual of PYFLEX (or FLEXWIN).

   In the portal this option corresponds to ‘\ *misfit\_type = pyflex’*.

2. **Kristeková’s misfit method**

   This is a python code based on the method developed by Kristeková et al.
   (2006) and Kristeková et al. (2009). The method compares observed and
   synthetic full-waveforms and allows the following time-frequency (TF)
   misfit criteria to be estimated:

   -  time-frequency envelope misfit (TFEM)

   -  time-frequency phase misfit (TFPM)

   -  time envelope misfit (TEM)

   -  time phase misfit (TPM)

   -  frequency envelope misfit (FEM)

   -  frequency phase misfit (FPM)

   -  envelope misfit (EM)

   -  phase misfit (PM)

   This method allows for comparing arbitrary time signals in their entire
   TF complexity, thus providing a detailed TF anatomy of the disagreement
   between two full signals from the point of view of both envelope and
   phase (Kristeková et al., 2009). For a complete description of the
   method see Kristeková et al. (2006) and Kristeková et al. (2009).

   In the portal this option corresponds to ‘\ *misfit\_type =
   time\_frequency’*.

3. **PYFLEX + Kristeková’s misfit method**

   In this case the time windows are selected using the code PYFLEX and
   then the time-frequency misfit criteria are estimated on this windows
   using Kristekova’s method.

   In the portal this corresponds to ‘\ *misfit\_type =
   pyflex\_and\_time\_frequency’*.

The section of the VERCE portal for misfit calculation is accessible
through the ‘\ *Misfit*\ ’ tab in the ‘\ *Forward Modelling*\ ’ panel
and it consists of the following sub-sections that allows for the set-up
of a misfit job.

-  *‘Setup’* tab:

  Select one of the processing job that have been run and that are listed
  in the upper window of this panel. Then select the ‘\ *Misfit type*\ ’
  from the drop-down menu considering that

-  ‘\ *pyflex’* corresponds to option 1 above

-  ‘\ *time*\ \_\ *frequency’* corresponds to option 2 above

-  ‘\ *pyflex\_and\_time\_frequency’* corresponds to option 3 above

  For each misfit procedure the lower window of the panel shows the
  corresponding parameters that should be set up by the user. In
  particular, for option 1 – ‘PYFLEX’ the tuning parameters control
  the window selection and are fully described in the manual of the
  code; for option 2 – ‘Kristeková’s misfit method’ the main
  parameters are the minimum and maximum period at which the waveforms
  have been filtered; option 3 – ‘PYFLEX + Kristeková’s misfit method‘
  contains all the parameters of the two previous options. (See Figure 7.8).

-  ‘\ *Submit’* tab:

   A summary of the chosen misfit method and set up parameters is shown in the upper window of this section. Then, you can setup the submission
   parameters in the lower window and launch the misfit job by clicking on ‘\ *Submit*\ ’ on the lower right.

-  ‘\ *Control*\ ’ tab:

   As always, the window shows a list of the misfit jobs that have been
   launched and the blue-eye icon links to the main ‘\ *Results*\ ’ page
   where the outputs of the selected job can be explored together with the
   provenance graphs. The outputs can be also accessed by searching for the
   specific misfit job directly from the ‘\ *Results*\ ’ panel (see section
   7.1) or from the ‘\ *iRODS*\ ’ panel (see section 7.4).

The output products of a misfit job are png files showing the waveform
comparison for each component of each selected seismic station. The
figures are different depending on the misfit option chosen in the
‘\ *Setup*\ ’ tab (see examples in Figures 7.9 and 7.10). To access
these output files use the ‘\ *Search*\ ’ button in the ‘\ *Data
products*\ ’ window of the ‘\ *Results*\ ’ tab searching for mime-type
‘\ *image/png*\ ’.

|image7|

**Figure 7.8:** Example of the set-up of a misfit job using in
combination PYFLEX and Kristeková’s method.

|image8|

**Figure 7.9:** Example of an output file produced by calculating the
misfit using PYFLEX. For each component of each station the figure shows
the observed data in black, the synthetic trace in red and the
short-term average/long-term average ratio in blue; the windows selected
by the code are highlighted.

|image9|

**Figure 7.10:** Example of an output file produced by calculating the
misfit using Kristeková’s method. For each component of each station the
figure shows the observed data in black, the synthetic trace in red;
moreover, it shows the Kristeková’s misfi criteria TFEM, TFPM, TEM, TPM,
FEM, FPM, EM, PM (see the text for details).

7.4 Accessing the results through iRODS
---------------------------------------

After any of the jobs described above (simulation, download, processing
and misfit) is finished, the output products are shipped from the HPC
resource, that performed the calculation, to the store repository of the
VERCE portal. This storage is managed through iRODS that provides a
repository shared among the federated nodes of the VERCE organisation.
How to create an account in iRODS is described in section 3 of this
manual, and after that you can log in selecting the ‘\ *IRODS*\ ’ panel
in the portal main menu (see Figure 7.11).

|image10|

**Figure 7.11:** Screenshot of the ‘IRODS’ panel in the VERCE portal

Entering iRODS gives you access to your personal folder where you can
navigate the results of all your completed jobs (of any type) as
anticipated above. The run results are organised in trees of subfolders
with the main directory called using the ‘\ *Name*\ ’ you have chosen
for your job (see section 5.6), as shown for example in Figure 7.12.

|image11|

**Figure 7.12:** Example of the iRODS subfolder structure containing
the results of the jobs.

A given job can be selected by double-clicking on the relative folder
and, navigating the subdirectories, you can access all the same input
and output files of each job that have been described in the above
sections.

It is very important that in order to visualise or download any output
or input data from the portal, both via the ‘\ *Results*\ ’ tab or the
‘\ *iRODS*\ ’ tab, you always need to firstly log in into the
‘\ *iRODS*\ ’ panel (Figure 7.11) because the storage database is
accessible only to authenticated users.
