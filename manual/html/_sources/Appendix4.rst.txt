Appendix 4 â€“ using dispel4py
============================

Dispel4Py is a python library that allows workflows to be written that
can easily scale to different sizes of computational resource, ranging
from your own laptop, to a large parallel supercomputer. This means that
you can devolve and test your workflow locally on your own machine
before transferring the workflow to a much larger computer to process a
large amount of data.

In seismology this could be particularly useful for performance
calculations with very large data sets, such as noise correlation.
Dispel4Py is used widely in the VERCE portal in the pre- and
post-processing workflows that are implemented there. This toolbox is
especially useful for any seismologist who is looking to speed up a data
application.

A4.1 Installing Dispel4Py
-------------------------

Firstly please ensure that you have an up to data version of Python
installed as described in appendix one. You can then install Dispel4Py
and its dependencies (such as MPI) as described below.

1. **Installing dispel4py:** Dispel4py can be installed using the
   command,

    pip install dispel4py

    Full instructions for installing dispel4py can be found at, 
	
	https://github.com/dispel4py/dispel4py

1. **Installing MPI and mpi4py (optional):** If you wish to explore the
   parallel mapping of dispel4py to MPI you may want to install these on
   your machine. Different implementations of MPI are available, for
   example Open MPI or MPICH2. Depending on your operating system MPI
   can be installed through the software manager. You can then install
   mpi4py with the command:

    pip install mpi4py

Full instructions can be found at: 

http://mpi4py.scipy.org/docs/usrman/install.html

A4.2 Using Disple4Py
--------------------

A full tutorial describing how to create workflows and perform
sequential and parallel processing using Dispel4Py can be found at the
link below.

For more information on the basic principles of Dispel4Py please see the
following presentation.

An advanced introduction for those who wish use Dispel4Py to create
workflows for their own applications can be found at the link below.
