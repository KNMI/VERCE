Appendix 3 – Using ObsPy
========================

ObsPy is a python based seismology toolbox, which can be used to deal
with seismic waveform data and earthquake catalogue information. The
toolbox can read a large range of seismic data formats and perform a
large range of processing applications such as filtering the data, and
misfit calculation.

Many of the pre- and post-processing applications within the portal use
python and ObsPy. The toolbox can also be used to format input data, for
instance producing an earthquake catalogue in quakeML format.

\ **A3.1 Installing Python and ObsPy**

1. **Installing Python:** Depending on your operating system this can be
   installed through the software manager. Alternatively the latest
   version of python can be installed here,

    https://www.python.org/downloads

    You will also require to specific python libraries that can be
    installed from GitHub as described below.

1. **Installing anaconda:** if you do not have super user privalages on
   your machine then both ObsPy and dispel4py (see appendix two) can be
   installed using Anaconda, a package to manage and deploy Python
   packages. Anaconda can be installed on mac and Linux operating
   systems as described here,

    http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html

    **Installing ObsPy**: Make sure you have a C and fortran compile
    installer. You can then install ObsPy with the command,

    conda install -c obspy obspy

    or, if you have not installed anaconda,

    sudo pip install obspy

    Full instructions can be found at

    https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki#installation
	
\ **A3.2 Other dependencies you need to run ObsPy are listed below;**

**numPy** – a toolbox for doing numerical applications in python.

sudo apt-get install python-numpy

**SciPy** – a generic scientific programming toolbox for applications in
python.

sudo apt-get install python-scipy

Additionally, in order to do the plotting parts of the tutorial below
you will need to install the following;

**Matplotlib** – a toolbox for creating plots and figures for python
applications. Figures are customised very easily and intuitively, and
can be exported in a number of different. Files can also be exported
easily to a .mat file for Matlab users.

sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib

\ **A3.3 Using ObsPy**

A full online python tutorial, that covers everything from a basic
introduction to ObsPy, up to more advanced applications such as
developing an automated processing workflow, can be found at the link
