5. A SPECFEM3D\_Cartesian simulation example
============================================

SPECFEM3D\_Cartesian is one of the principle solvers used in the VERCE
portal. It is designed to run waveform simulations on local to regional
scales, where local variations in bathymetry or topography may be
significant but large-scale features, such as the Earth’s curvature, may
be reasonably ignored. The Cartesian version of SPECFEM requires a
pre-made mesh that includes features of the area or region such as the
topography. These meshes can be produced by third party programs such as
GEOCUBIT (Casarotti et al., 2008), and are often refined for a
particular velocity model from a local or regional scale tomography for
instance. These meshes can be relatively complex to produce. However, in
the VERCE platform, a range of pre-loaded meshes is available. Users can
also upload their own mesh and velocity model for a region of interest.
This more advance use is described in chapter 8.

In the following section we will describe a step-by-step example of the
set up of a forward simulation with SPECFEM3D\_Cartesian.

5.1 Preparing the portal
------------------------

Before you are able to run a simulation you must log in to the VERCE
portal, and upload a proxy certificate as described in section 3 of this
guide. Once you have done this, you should be able to use all parts of
the portal for the next 24 hours (or the lifetime of your proxy
certificate).

5.2 Selecting a solver, mesh and velocity model
-----------------------------------------------

The waveform simulations are run from the ‘Forward Modelling’ tab of the
VERCE portal, shown in figure 5.1. First you must select the ‘Solver’
tab from the top of the forward modelling panel. In the first drop down
menu you must select the solver. This is the code that will perform the
full waveform simulation. Currently the VERCE platform supports
SPECFEM3D\_Cartesian, which is designed to simulate waveforms on the
local/regional scale, and SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE, designed for 3D simulations
in the whole Earth. Specify one of the two codes by selecting
SPECFEM3D\_Cartesian or SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE in the drop down menu labelled
‘Solvers’. For this example we select SPECFEM3D\_Cartesian. Once you
have done this you will see that the right hand side of the panel is
populated with the input parameters for the selected code, which are
categorised into ten groups.

You can now select the area that you wish to run a simulation for from
the drop down menu labelled ‘Meshes’. Once you have selected the
relevant mesh, the map on the left of the ‘Forward Modelling’ panel will
zoom to the area concerned, and the area the mesh covers will be
outlined with a black box as shown below, in Figure 5.1.

|image0|

**Figure 5.1:** Selecting a solver and mesh for Northern Italy. On the
left panel the colours show the local geology, and known faults are
plotted in black. On the right panel the drop down menu showing the
meshes that are currently loaded in is shown. The input parameters for
the solver can also be seen at the bottom of the right panel.

Once you have selected a solver and a mesh you can then select a
velocity model for the given area. Most of the meshes currently only
have one velocity model associated with them. But in theory it is
possible to have more than one velocity model for each mesh, as long as
the area of the velocity model covers at least the mesh dimensions. This
could for instance allow different tomographic models to be compared.

5.3 Specifying the input parameters for SPECFEM3D\_Cartesian
------------------------------------------------------------

The input parameters for SPECFEM3D\_Cartesian are broken up into 10
categories, which are briefly described in Appendix 1. For a basic
simulation, many of the parameters can be left at the default setting
within the portal, but it is important to understand the meaning of
these input flags for more advanced uses. For explanation of the use of
the flags you can simply hold your curser above the question mark to the
right of the flag or variable for a brief description. For a fuller
description of these parameters please refer to Appendix 1, or for full
details refer to the manual of SPECFEM3D\_Cartesian.

It is very important that you check the parameters in Group 0,
especially insuring that the number of processors (NPROC), the time step
(DT) used in the simulation, and length of the simulation are all set
correctly. In particular, for each mesh/velocity model pair there is a
maximum value of DT above which the simulation becomes unstable (see
section 8.2.1 for details); thus for all your simulations we suggest to
use the best values of DT for each mesh/model pair reported in Figure
4.4.

Other parameters in Group 1-9 can be left as default for this exercise,
but also allow you to specify details of the simulation. While the
platform gives you as much flexibility as possible to vary these
parameters, the user must ensure that reasonable values are used,
otherwise the simulation may not run, or may not produce reasonable
results. The aspects of the simulation controlled by each group are
described briefly below.

The final set up of the workflow is shown in Figure 5.2.

|image1|

**Figure 5.2:** Final setup of the workflow for the simple example. The
area of Northern Italy which is to be simulated is outlined by the black
box.

5.4. Selecting earthquakes
--------------------------

Next the earthquakes to be simulated are defined in the ‘Earthquakes’
tab at the top right of the ‘Forward Modelling’ page. There are a number
of earthquake catalogues pre-loaded into the VERCE platform, including
the global CMT catalogue, which provides a starting data set for any
area that we have a model and mesh for. It is also possible to load in
your own bespoke catalogue of earthquake moment tensors, as described in
greater detail in section 8.4. Given that the model and mesh selected in
our example is in Northern Italy, we can however use the INGV focal
mechanism data set, which is likely to have a larger range of events
down to smaller magnitudes.

The earthquake catalogue you wish to search is selected using the drop
down menu at the top of the ‘Earthquakes’ tab. You can then search for
earthquakes in a range of magnitudes, depths and time. In this example
we have searched for all earthquakes from magnitude Mw 4.0 – 9.0, at up
to 100000 m depth that occurred within the model and mesh area in the
year 2012. The earthquake of interest can then be selected either by
ticking the box next to the earthquake in the list in the bottom right
of the panel, or by selecting the location of the earthquake on the map
in the left of the panel. It is also possible to select multiple events
from this page. This will then submit the same number of jobs as events
that you have selected, and produce waveforms for each of them. This
would then allow multiple events to be used in an inversion for
instance.

|image2|

**Figure 5.3:** The earthquake selection page of the forward modelling
tool. Events are shown from the INGV catalogue. The locations of the
events are shown in the summary map on the left, and details of the
events are shown in the bottom right hand part of the panel. The event
or events to be modelled can be selected from either of these panels.

For now though, just submit one event. In Figure 5.3 an earthquake in
the centre of the mesh has been selected so that we see a nice clear
waveform on all stations. You can select any event you are interested
in, but be aware that events close to the limits of the mesh may be more
greatly affected by the absorbing boundary conditions at the edges of
the model.

5.5. Selecting stations
-----------------------

The seismometers where you want to simulate the synthetic seismogram can
then be selected under the ‘Stations’ tab on the right hand side of the
‘\ *Forward Modelling’* panel. The portal is configured to output the
synthetic waveforms at points where real seismometers exist so that the
synthetic waveforms can be directly compared to the observed waveforms
recorded at these stations.

There are many seismic networks loaded into the VERCE portal that can be
used. To see all of the stations that are available within the mesh and
model area you can simply select one ‘Provider’ and ‘\*’ (i.e., any
network) in the drop down box at the top of the ‘Stations’ panel.
Alternatively you can select a given network you are interested in (or
have the data for), for instance the INGV network (network code IV). You
can then manually select the stations you are interested in by clicking
on the stations in the map view, or selecting the tick box next to the
station information in the right hand panel. All of the stations in this
list can be selected by selecting the tick box at the top of the list.
See Figure 5.4.

|image3|

**Figure 5.4:** The station selection panel. Stations are shown inside
the area of the model and mesh (shown by the black box) for the INGV
network. The stations (shown in blue) can be selected individually from
the map or from the station list. All the available stations can be
selected by ticking the tick box in the title bar (labelled 0/0 when no
stations are selected).

While selecting a large number of stations will not affect the overall
time taken or computational cost of the simulation, the more stations
you select the longer it will take to move the simulation output to
memory where you can then access it. For large simulations it is most
efficient therefore to output seismograms for all the stations that you
may be interested in.

5.6. Submitting the job
-----------------------

You can then select the workflow you wish to use and submit your job.
Currently one workflow is available, for the super computer at SCAI
Fraunhofer
(`https://www.scai.fraunhofer.de) <http://www.hpc.cineca.it/)>`__. Other
workflows will be introduced, allowing users to run the simulation on a
variety of HPC resources across Europe. Each workflow is configured to a
different machine, and some machines have more than one workflow
available on them. You can then select the relevant workflow (here we
have selected ‘SCAI\_mpi\_SPECFEM\_PRODUCTION’) for the HPC resource you
wish to submit to, and enter a name and description of the run. Please
note that the name of the model must be 20 characters or less, and can
only consists of letters, numbers and decimals. Other characters are not
accepted.

If you have selected more than one event to simulate, you may select the
‘Process the events in parallel’ box. This submits each of the events to
the queue of the resources you have selected as separate jobs, rather
than running the jobs in serial (one after another). This can speed up
the process of simulating several earthquake events for the same
velocity model.

|image4|

**Figure 5.5:** Available workflow from the top drop down menu of the
‘submit’ tab of the forward modelling page.

5.7. Monitoring the job
-----------------------

Once the job has been submitted, the status and progress of the job can
be monitored from the ‘Control’ tab. This brings up a list of all of the
jobs that have recently been submitted as shown below.

|image5|

**Figure 5.6:** Jobs listed in the ‘Control’ tab.
