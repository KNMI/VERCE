Appendix 2 – SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE’s Flags
=====================================

The input parameters for the code of SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE are briefly
described below. For a detailed description please consult the
SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE manual.

A2.1 Group 0 - Basic 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image0|

**Figure A2.1:** Parameter form for ‘Group 0 - Basic’.

**NPROC** is the number of processors that the simulation will run on.
This is essentially dependent upon the high-performance computer and
workflow you intend to submit your job to.

**RECORD\_LENGTH\_IN\_MINUTES** is the time in minutes you want to run
the simulation for.

**MODEL** is the velocity model to be used in the simulation. There is a
range of models pre-loaded into the solver SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE. (See the
code’s manual for all the available options).

**GPU\_MODE** allows SPECFEM to be run on high performance computers
that use graphical processing units (GPUs) rather than the more
conventional CPU (central processing unit). All the workflows currently
available on the VERCE platform use CPUs, so you should always leave
this box unchecked.

A2.2 Group 1 – Inverse Problem 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|image1|

**Figure A2.2:** Parameter form for ‘Group 1 – Inverse Problem’.

**SIMULATION\_TYPE** is set to ‘\ *forward*\ ’ by default to model the
wave-field from an earthquake.

**NOISE\_TOMOGRAPHY** is set to ‘\ *earthquake simulation*\ ’ by default
as the noise tomography applications of SPECFEM are not currently
supported within the VERCE platform.

**SAVE\_FORWARD** is selected if the last step of the wave-field is to
be saved. This enables to back reconstruct the seismic wave-field, but
requires a large amount of storage space and it is not yet supported by
the VERCE platform.

memory installed per core in Gigabyte.
