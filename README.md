# VERCE Science Gateway

This project contains (some components of) the VERCE Science Gateway as available at https://portal.verce.eu/

## Installation

The forward-modelling portlet requires a working installation of the WS-PGRADE/gUSE liferay-based science portal. Once running it can be deployed as a portlet. A few additional components are required, which will hopefully be shared here in the future.

The scigateway-api is a WEB API for the generation of the solverinput files and moment tensor images. It runs with the following modules:

1. Obspy 0.10.1
2. Twisted 16.2.0
