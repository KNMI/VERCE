This is a dispel4py graph which produces a workflow that sends copies of the output data from the producer node (words) 
to two nodes (filter1 and filter2), and the outputs of those two filters are merged in the last node (count). 

.. image:: /api/images/grouping_split_merge.png

It can be executed with MPI and STORM. 

* MPI: Please, locate yourself into the dispel4py directory. 

    Execute the MPI mapping as follows::

        mpiexec -n <number mpi_processes> python -m dispel4py.worker_mpi [-a name_dispel4py_graph] [-f file containing the input dataset in JSON format]
	[-i number of iterations/runs'] [-s]
	
    The argument '-s' forces to run the graph in a simple processing, which means that the first node of the graph will be executed in a process, and the rest of nodes will be        executed in a second process.  
    When <-i number of interations/runs> is not indicated, the graph is executed once by default. 	
    
    For example::
    
        mpiexec -n 4 python -m dispel4py.worker_mpi dispel4py.examples.graph_testing.grouping_split_merge 


    .. note::
    
        Each node in the graph is executed as a separate MPI process. 
        This graph has 4 nodes. For this reason we need at least 4 MPI processes to execute it. 
	
    Output::
    
    	Processing 1 iterations
    	Processes: {'RandomFilter2': [3], 'WordCounter3': [1], 'RandomFilter1': [0], 'RandomWordProducer0': [2]}
    	RandomFilter1 (rank 0): I'm a bolt
    	RandomWordProducer0 (rank 2): I'm a spout
    	WordCounter3 (rank 1): I'm a bolt
    	Rank 2: Sending terminate message to [0]
    	Rank 2: Sending terminate message to [3]
    	RandomWordProducer0 (rank 2): Processed 1 input block(s)
    	RandomWordProducer0 (rank 2): Completed.
    	RandomFilter2 (rank 3): I'm a bolt
    	Rank 3: Sending terminate message to [1]
    	RandomFilter2 (rank 3): Processed 1 input block(s)
    	RandomFilter2 (rank 3): Completed.
    	Rank 0: Sending terminate message to [1]
    	RandomFilter1 (rank 0): Processed 1 input block(s)
    	RandomFilter1 (rank 0): Completed.
    	WordCounter3 (rank 1): Processed 2 input block(s)
    	WordCounter3 (rank 1): Completed.
        
    .. note:: 
        
        As those PEs are filtering randomly the output could be completely different.
