'''
This is a dispy graph which produces a workflow that splits the data and sends it to two nodes (cons1 and cons2)
and the output of those two nodes is merged by another node (last). 

.. image:: /api/images/split_merge.png

It can be executed with MPI and STORM. 

* MPI: Please, locate yourself into the dispy directory. 

    Execute the MPI mapping as follows::

        mpiexec -n <number mpi_processes> python -m dispel4py.worker_mpi <name_dispy_graph> <-f file containing the input dataset in JSON format>
	<-i number of iterations/runs'> <-s>
	
    The argument '-s' forces to run the graph in a simple processing, which means that the first node of the graph will be executed in a process, and the rest of nodes will be        executed in a second process.  
    When <-i number of interations/runs> is not indicated, the graph is executed once by default. 	
        

    For example::
    
        mpiexec -n 4 python -m dispel4py.worker_mpi test.split_merge
        
    .. note::
    
        Each node in the graph is executed as a separate MPI process. 
        This graph has 4 nodes. For this reason we need at least 4 MPI processes to execute it. 
        
    Output::
    
        Processing 1 iterations
        Processes: {'TestProducer0': [0], 'TestOneInOneOutWriter2': [1], 'TestOneInOneOut1': [3], 'TestTwoInOneOut3': [2]}
        TestProducer0 (rank 0): I'm a spout
        Rank 0: Sending terminate message to [3]
        Rank 0: Sending terminate message to [1]
        TestProducer0 (rank 0): Processed 1 input block(s)
        TestProducer0 (rank 0): Completed.
        TestOneInOneOutWriter2 (rank 1): I'm a bolt
        Rank 1: Sending terminate message to [2]
        TestOneInOneOutWriter2 (rank 1): Processed 1 input block(s)
        TestOneInOneOutWriter2 (rank 1): Completed.

        TestOneInOneOut1 (rank 3): I'm a bolt
        Rank 3: Sending terminate message to [2]
